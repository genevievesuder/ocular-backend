    title: "Scope of practice and future of optometry", 
    content: "Hello everyone, One thing that I've been thinking a lot about lately is the scope of practice for optometry.
    In comparison to the health care fields of practice we have med school, optometry, dentistry and a few other schools as well. With dentistry a dentist goes through 4 years of dental school and then can practice as a general dentist but then they also practice dental surgery like implants. Technically, (or so I thought) a dentist can only do implants if they do med school after dental school and get an MD DDS. There is a pathway where after dental school they do three years of med school and then go into OMFS type of surgery which includes implants. But technically general dentists do it too. For optometry the biggest hurdle we face in growing our profession is the medical counter part of Ophthalmology. The biggest argument we face with adding lasers and surgical procedures to our career is that we aren't trained enough. This is true because an optometrist does 4 years of optometry school and then practices general optometry but then we are trying to add surgery as well, why not increase the length of our training? OMFS originally required dentists to go through additional training, why not add to our optometry field. We can have a pathway that allows those with OD degrees to also do three of med schools. You can take the Step exams and the USML but skip the clerkships and then do residencies where you learn more about surgery. Then you can practice surgery. There is no pathway that exists currently. Yes a dentist can do implants without the med school pathway but that pathway does exist. I think this pathway will go a long way in increasing our credibility worldwide. The biggest argument we face is that we aren't trained enough but we can change that. This doesn't take away from Ophthalmology the same way OMFS doesn't take away from plastic surgery. It also gives another pathway to those who wish to explore eye health with the traditional med school pathway. Schools that have medical schools and optometry schools should consider adding pathways to increase the scope of our field. This makes more sense then just having 4 years of optometry and certificates when it comes to surgery.",

    title: "How do *you* prescribe ADDs for presbyopes", 
    content: "What's your prescribing philosophy for presbyopes? There is so much testing you can do for ADD determination, but I find that prescribing age-estimated adds works just as well as NRA/PRA balancing, FCC, etc., the majority of the time. So much so that I virtually never do near testing in the phoropter anymore. Occasionally, for patients that I know have unusual working distances (especially concert musicians), I'll stick it in a trial frame and add plus until they're happy.
    Side question ‚Äî who here has ever prescribed different ADDs between eyes? And if so, how'd that go for you?",

    content: "What intra-ocular measuring device do you use in your practice? My practice has a Nidek non-contact tonometer, an I-Care 100, Perkins applanation tonometer and a Pascal dynamic contour tonometry. I mostly use non-contact because its fast and I get an auto-refraction. I-care 100 if I need to remeasure IOP or px cannot access the autoref machine/machine could not measure IOP. I am thinking of utilising the Pascal dynamic contour tonometry more as it does not get influeced by corneal biometry unlike all the other methods listed above. The hospital seems to rely on tonopen or Goldman applanation tonometry. So perhaps for best patiebt outcomes, I should get one of these devices so that my measurements are more in line with the hospitals measurement. So what do you use to measure intra-ocular pressure and why?",
